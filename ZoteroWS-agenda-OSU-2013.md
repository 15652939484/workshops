Hi Sebastian,
Thanks - I did it make it back safe and sound.

The workshop will be held in the Autzen classroom, which is located on the main (2nd) floor of the Valley Library.  Enter through the main doors on the north side of the building, go through both sets of sliding glass doors, and walk straight ahead toward the information/reference desks.  Before reaching the desks, there is a main avenue.  Take a left onto this avenue and the classroom is the first (and only) room on the right before you reach a stairwell.

The campus does have guest wifi available, so participants are welcome to bring their laptops or use the computers in the Autzen classroom.

Here is a link to directions on how to travel to the library:  http://osulibrary.oregonstate.edu/visit

Here is the parking info:
Visitor permits may be obtained at any one of the ten 'Pay & Display' stations located throughout campus which accept coin or currency only. Campus map downloadable, printable PDF format (http://oregonstate.edu/dept/facilities/taps/sites/default/files/taps_brochure_12-13.pdf)  The cost for a daily permit is $7.00 for the day or $1.00 an hour up to a maximum of four hours. Visitors may park in student and visitor lots only for the day the permit is purchased. There is a new visitor brochure Visitor Brochure (http://oregonstate.edu/dept/facilities/taps/sites/default/files/visitor_brochure.pdf) which contains pertinent information for visitors.

And a note for folks who may have been here before - the parking lot immediately to the west of the library is no more - it has been torn up and construction is underway to put in a new building.

It is also possible to find free street parking (particularly in the summer, if you arrive in the morning) to the east of campus starting at about 11th street.  Allow about a 10-minute walk if you plan to go this route.

Food - there is a coffee shop with food options (salads, sandwiches) in the library.  Also, there are more restaurants in the Memorial Union.  Here is the list of those options:  http://mu.oregonstate.edu/restaurants.  And people are welcome to bring their own food - there is also a microwave available in Java II, the coffee shop in the library.

Let me know if you think of anything else.
